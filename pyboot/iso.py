"""The real-OS test: attach one or MORE real distro ISOs and boot them from MyBoot.

Stages a MINIMAL ESP (MyBoot only — no decoys), then attaches every ISO you pass
as its OWN volume. MyBoot scans them all, excludes its own loader, and lists each
ISO as a separate entry — the true n-OS test across many volumes at once. Selecting
one chainloads that ISO's loader FROM ITS OWN VOLUME via device path, so it finds
its own kernel and boots.

Modes:
  --ui    (default) open a QEMU window and pick an OS from MyBoot's menu, watch it
          boot, close the window, and repeat for the next — the honest n-OS test.
  --no-ui headless: assert MyBoot scanned all volumes and discovered one entry per
          ISO.
