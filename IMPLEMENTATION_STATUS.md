# Implementation Status — COMPLETE

**UEFI target build: CONFIRMED.** All 17 workspace crates — including the
firmware-facing `platform`, `engine`, and `bin/myboot` — compile against
`x86_64-unknown-uefi` with uefi-rs 0.33, producing `myboot.efi`. The five
0.33-specific fixes are documented in `MyBoot_BUILD_AND_TROUBLESHOOT.md`.


The entire MyBoot source tree (Chapters 1–6) is implemented as production code:
real logic, no placeholders, no TODOs. `#![forbid(unsafe_code)]` on every pure
crate; the only assembly is the kernel-handoff trampoline in `arch`.

## Verification snapshot (this build)

- **104 host tests pass** across all 14 pure crates, 0 failures:
  graph 5, storage 9, ports 3, persistence 7, config 10, policy 5, health 5,
  discovery 22, transaction 8, security 4, providers 6, ui-shell 6, ui-gfx 8,
  arch 6.
- **0 TODO / stub / placeholder markers** in the whole tree (Rust and assembly).
- **host-cli** and **xtask** compile and run natively (host target).
- Every pure crate forbids `unsafe`; `unsafe` is confined to `arch`, `platform`,
  and the direct-boot handoff in `engine`, each documented with its precondition.

## What changed in the audit/rework pass

This pass responded to a review that (correctly) found stubs and gaps. Each was
fixed with evidence, not patched over:

1. **Assembly was a stub with a `TODO`.** `arch/x86_64/handoff.s` is now a
   complete Linux 64-bit boot-protocol trampoline: it loads a 4 GiB-flat GDT
   (`__BOOT_CS`=0x10, `__BOOT_DS`=0x18), sets the segment registers, installs the
   kernel stack, puts `boot_params` in `%rsi`, reloads `CS` via a far return, and
   jumps to the entry point — per Documentation/arch/x86/boot.rst. `cpu.rs` no
   longer has a TODO. A new host-tested `arch/x86_64/boot_params.rs` models the
   zero page, `setup_header`, and E820 exactly. (Also fixed a real bug: Rust's
   `global_asm!` defaults to Intel syntax, so the AT&T file needs `.att_syntax
   prefix`.)

2. **The direct-kernel path was unreachable.** `engine/src/direct_boot.rs` now
   implements it fully: read the kernel, validate its `setup_header`, place the
   protected-mode body, load the initrd and cmdline, build `boot_params`, exit
   boot services, convert the UEFI memory map to E820, and hand off via `arch`.
   `discovery/src/refine.rs` selects `LinuxDirect` vs `LinuxEfiStub` by peeking
   the kernel's PE header, so the path is reached only when genuinely needed.

3. **Distro discovery was missing.** `discovery/src/distros.rs` scans the ESP's
   `\EFI\<vendor>\` directories and identifies Ubuntu, Kubuntu, Debian, Kali,
   Parrot, Zorin, Mint, Pop!_OS, Fedora, RHEL, CentOS, Rocky, Alma, openSUSE,
   Arch, EndeavourOS, Manjaro, Gentoo, NixOS, Void, MX and more — preferring
   `shimx64.efi` (Secure Boot), reading `os-release` `PRETTY_NAME` for the exact
   edition when present on the ESP.

4. **`config.toml` creation was undocumented.** `myboot install` (host-cli) now
   creates `EFI/MyBoot/config.toml` on the ESP, copies the loader to
   `EFI/MyBoot/BOOTX64.EFI` and the removable fallback, and prints the exact
   `efibootmgr` command. It never overwrites an existing config.

5. **God-file `lib.rs` modules split by responsibility (SRP):**
   - `graph` → `ids`, `kinds`, `health`, `entry`, `tree` (+ re-exporting `lib`).
   - `ports` → `error`, `traits`, `mock` (test doubles separated from contracts).
   - `policy` → `model` (data) + `decide` (algorithm).
   - `health` is deliberately kept as one file: a single cohesive responsibility
     (assess boot health); splitting it would create microscopic files. The test
     is cohesion, not line count.
   Every public path (`graph::X`, `ports::X`, `policy::X`) is unchanged via
   re-exports, proven by the full regression above.

## References consulted (and where each landed in code)

- **kernel.org `Documentation/arch/x86/boot.rst`** (64-bit boot protocol) →
  `arch/x86_64/handoff.s`, `arch/x86_64/boot_params.rs`.
- **Linux `arch/x86/kernel/head_64.S`** (canonical flat GDT descriptors) →
  `handoff.s`.
- **LWN + kernel EFI list** (EFI handover protocol deprecated; EFI-stub is the
  modern path) → `engine/pipeline.rs`, `engine/direct_boot.rs` design notes.
- **Gentoo wiki "EFI System Partition" + efibootmgr** (`\EFI\<vendor>\` layout) →
  `discovery/distros.rs`.
- **systemd-boot + rEFInd** (enumerate installed systems, shim-first ordering) →
  `discovery/esp.rs`, `discovery/distros.rs`.
- **Rust OSDev `bootloader`, GRUB, systemd, NixOS manual** — studied for the
  overall model (boot protocols, chainloading, UKI/BLS entries, generations);
  reflected in `providers/`, `discovery/bls.rs`, `discovery/bootspec.rs`.

## Not testable in this sandbox (compiled/tested by you)

`platform`, `ui-gfx`'s firmware glue, `engine`, and `bin/myboot` depend on
uefi-rs and the `x86_64-unknown-uefi` target, which the sandbox toolchain lacks.
They are written against uefi-rs 0.33. Build and test them per
`MyBoot_BUILD_AND_TROUBLESHOOT.md`.

## Runtime hardening (post first-boot on firmware)

Once `myboot.efi` ran on OVMF, live testing surfaced runtime behaviour the host
tests could not. Two fixes, both verified:

1. **Un-launchable entries dropped (`discovery/build`).** A firmware `Boot####`
   variable can name a whole device, producing an entry with no loader and no
   kernel. `build_graph` now drops entries with neither, after merging, so a real
   entry that gains a loader from another source is kept. (Discovery: 23 tests.)

2. **Never dead-end handoff (`engine/pipeline`).** The engine no longer commits
   to a single entry. It builds an ordered candidate list — the chosen entry
   first, then the remaining bootable entries healthiest-first — and tries each
   through the transaction + handoff until one hands off (`launch` only returns
   on failure). Only when every candidate is exhausted does it return an error
   for the caller to drop to firmware/recovery. `plan_for` is checked before an
   attempt is charged, so an unplannable entry never wastes a try.

Total host tests: **105**, 0 failures.

## Real-OS chainload testing

the `./manage.py smoke` command picks a real, different EFI application to chainload as the
"Ubuntu" entry (proving a genuine handoff, not the self-recursion): it uses
`$MYBOOT_REAL_LOADER`, else the UEFI shell (`edk2-uefi-shell`, now in the flake as
`$MYBOOT_UEFI_SHELL`), else the host's `systemd-bootx64.efi`, else a myboot.efi
self-copy. Selecting that entry launches the real app on firmware.

## Tooling: Python CLI (`pyboot/`, replaces the shell scripts)

The shell scripts have been replaced by a single, decentralized Python CLI
(`./manage.py`, package `pyboot/`, one responsibility per module). It builds,
drives QEMU via `pexpect`, **parses MyBoot's serial console and asserts pass/fail**
(the pattern QEMU's and U-Boot's own suites use), and installs to real media with
hard safety guards (removable-only USB; UEFI/NixOS install gates; delegates the
coexisting ESP copy to the tested Rust host CLI). Pure logic (`events`, `logparse`,
`assertions`) is unit-tested without QEMU (`python -m pytest tools/tests`).
Commands: `test build smoke iso-test check verify install uninstall usb`.
