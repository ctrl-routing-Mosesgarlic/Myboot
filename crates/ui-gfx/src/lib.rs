//! ui-gfx — the graphical boot menu (report §3.10.1, Figures 3.5–3.6). A driving
//! adapter over the Boot Graph. It is deliberately uefi-FREE: it draws to a
//! `Canvas` trait, so the menu model, layout, theme and text rendering are all
//! host-tested. The `engine` implements `Canvas` for `platform::Framebuffer`,
//! keeping the one firmware dependency at the composition root.
//!
//! The UI is NOT the boot architecture — it is only the presentation layer over
//! the boot-management core (per the project's own diagram).
