#![no_std]

//! arch — architecture-specific low-level support and the project's ONLY
//! hand-written assembly (report §1.7, §4.4).
//!
//! IMPORTANT — what assembly is and is NOT for here:
//!   * Chainloading (Windows Boot Manager, Linux EFI-stub, generic .efi) uses
//!     the firmware's LoadImage/StartImage and needs NO assembly.
//!   * Assembly is required ONLY for:
//!       (1) the final handoff when DIRECTLY loading a kernel (LinuxDirect):
//!           set registers/stack per the boot protocol and jump to the entry
//!           point AFTER ExitBootServices (see x86_64/handoff.s);
//!       (2) a few privileged CPU operations not exposed safely by core
//!           (cli/hlt, control-register access) — see x86_64/cpu.rs.
//!   * Everything else in MyBoot is Rust. Keep this crate deliberately tiny.
